# Computer Vision Nanodegree

This repository contains the Facial Keypoint Detection project, which is the first project in the Computer Vision Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Facial Keypoint Detection
>[P1_Facial_Keypoints](https://github.com/itoro-michael/udacity-facial-keypoint-detection/tree/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints)

The Facial Keypoint Detection project uses 6 layer LeNet style convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
find 68 facial keypoints on a face. The keypoints are positioned on the features of a face, such as 
the eyebrow, nose, and mouth. The points could therefore be used in a number of applications including 
emotion detection and facial feature classification.
